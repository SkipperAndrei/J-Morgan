## Project idea
* This project is a banking application that implements basic functionalities like users, accounts, credit cards and payments
* The application also has more complex features, like splitting payments between multiple users, freezing accounts and generating account reports 
* The project gets it's input in the form of JSON nodes, that will be parsed in the classes from the "fileio" package

## Design constrains
* Each user can have multiple accounts, which can be of two types: classic account and savings account. The difference is that the savings account has an interest rate associated, which can increase the account's funds after some time.
* The user can't generate a spending report for a saving account.
* Each account can have multiple cards, which can also be of two types : <b>classic</b> and <b>one-time pay</b>. The one-time pay card will regenerate it's card number with every transaction made.
* The user can set aliases for his/her accounts, but it can only be referenced as the receiver of a "send money" account, otherwise the command will generate an error.
* A user can set a <i><b>unique</b></i> alias for his/her accounts.
* A user can set a minimum balance for his/her accounts to avoid excessive spending
* A card can only have three statuses : <b>active</b>, <b>warning</b> and <b>frozen</b>.
* If a card becomes frozen, it can't be unfrozen.
* Every split payment initiated must be accepted or declined.
* The user has the same service plan on all accounts.
* The business account has the service plan of his owner.
* The spending threshold cashback is repeatable.
* The Nr. of transactions discounts can be cashed in once per account.

## Functionalities
* <b>Adding an account </b>
* <b>Adding funds to an account</b>
* <b>Cash in the interest rate in a saving account</b>
* <b>Checking the status of a card</b>
* <b>Creating a new card</b>
* <b>Deleting an account or a card</b>
* <b>Making online payments using a credit card</b>
* <b>Generating the transactions for a user on all it's accounts</b>
* <b>Generating a classic report for an account</b>
* <b>Sending money online</b>
* <b>Setting an alias for an account</b>
* <b>Setting a minimum balance for an account</b>
* <b>Generating a spending report for an account</b>
* <b>Splitting a payment between multiple users</b>
* <b>Possibility to get discounts and cashback from the commerciants</b>
* <b>Having a service plan that can affect payments and account withdrawals</b>
* <b>Creating a shared account used across a business</b>
* <b>The shared account supports an employee hierarchy</b>

## Implementation

### Databases
* The application has a centralised database where all the users and their information will be kept. Since the database is global and unique, i decided to implement it using a Singleton design pattern.
* The exchange rate database is represented by a weighted oriented graph, implemented using <i>JGraphT</i>.
* The commerciant database is also unique and is implemented using a <b> Singleton design pattern</b>
* Since the application is query oriented, every time a conversion between 2 nodes that are in the same component is requested, but there isn't a direct edge between them, that edge will be added at the first query that involves them
* Moreover, as the exchange rate database is also unique, there can only be one instance of it during the program, revealing the Singleton design pattern.
* For the speed of the queries, important information in the user database will be stored in several hash-maps, so that the "get" operation will have a cost of O(1).

### Commands
* Each class that represents a command will have to implement the "command" interface.
* This means that each class that represents a command will implement a method that executes a command and a method that generates output for that command.
* These methods will be called in "main".
* Commands can generate output directly to stdout, or in the transactions list.
* Since commands can produce errors, the CommandConstants enum has the current present signal codes.
* The commands are instantiated using a <b> factory design pattern </b> in the FactoryCommand class.
* Then, the commands are executed in a sequential manner, and using the <b> command design pattern </b>.
* The split payment, which requires an accept/reject from every account involved, is implemented using an additional class, SplitTracker. In this class, which is also a <b>Singleton</b>, all the pending Split Payments are placed in an ArrayList, awaiting for response.
* When a split payment, was fully accepted, it is removed from the ArrayList, and it is executed and output is generated.

### Service plans
* Each user is assigned a service plan, that can be upgraded.
* Commissions and cashback received from commerciants is implemented using the <b> strategy design pattern </b>.
* The classes from the plans package that implement the Plan interface are responsible for the correct strategies.

### Cashback and discounts
* For this feature, I created a utility class called CashbackTracker.
* For the discounts, I used three signal codes : <b> NOT_ELIGIBLE </b>, <b> ELIGIBLE </b> and <b> CASHED_IN </b>.
* The need for these codes relies on the fact that an account can cash in the discounts only once.
* The discount codes are updated when the methods <b> checkFoodDiscount, checkClothesDiscount </b> and <b> checkTechDiscount </b> are called in the <b> handleCommerciantPayment </b> method in the Account class.
* The cashback is calculated by calling the <b> calculateNrTransactionsCashback </b> and <b> spendingTransCashback </b> methods in <b> handleCommerciantPayment </b>

### Business account
* The BusinessAccount class has more complex functionalities, than the other type of accounts in this application.
* This is because, unlike the other two types of accounts, this one is shared, so additional checks must be enforced.
* This type of account has two inner classes. 
* The first one, <b>EmployeeInfo</b>, stores the name, email, role, how much he/she spent and deposited and also the transactions.
* The last part of information is relevant for business reports.
* The second inner class, <b>CommerciantInfo</b>, stores the name of the commerciant, the amount paid by the employees and the employees that made transactions to them.
* This class is only used for generating the commerciant type of the business report.
